This repository contains the code accompanying my talk, "How does text become
data?".

The "src" directory contains the actual code. The .ipynb files are the
interactive IPython notebooks.  The .py versions of the files will run in
ordinary Python, and just have oddly-formatted comments from IPython that you
can disregard.
